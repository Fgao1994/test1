# Coupling Components and Services for IEM

Integrated environmental modelling (IEM) couples environmental models, geoprocessing algorithms, and data together to solve complex environmental problems. There are two prominent modelling frameworks for IEM: component based and service oriented frameworks. The former one has been widely employed in local computer environments, and has its advantage in having concrete and community-wide tools. The latter one can take advantage of Web technologies for integrating distributed environmental models. This project takes the best of both frameworks. Models are shared on the Web as WebSocket services. A hybrid approach to leverage OpenMI and WebSocket for coupling components and services is proposed to provide a flexible IEM environment.
